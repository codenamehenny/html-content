-- HTML ASSIGNMENT --
~ Overview
This project demonstrates basic understanding of HTML concepts. This
is a complete HTML webpage showcasing key features such as forms,
tables, navigation bars, and images. The goal is to build a
functional and visually organized page using valid HTML 5 syntax.

~ Key Components Implemented
1. Basic HTML Page Structure:
The assignment begins with a standard HTML5 structure, ensuring proper
formatting for responsive design using the meta viewport tag

2. Form Creation:
A basic contact form with the following fields:
    - Name: a text input for the user's name
    - Email: an email input for validating user email addresses
    - Message: A textarea with larger user input field
    - Submit Button: Allows users to submit their information
    - Bonus: Radio Group added asking how the user found the site

3. Table Structure:
A table with a thin border was created to display sample product data
with the following items:
    - Columns: Product Name, Price, and Quantity
    - Rows: 3 example products (shirt, pants and hat) with their data
    - Bonus: A header row was added to label the columns

4. Navigation Bar:
A basic navigation bar was implemented using an unordered list 
(<ul>) which links to Home, About, and Contact pages

The <nav> element was used to semantically define the navigation area

5. Images:
Two images were added to the page with alternate text:
    - A placeholder image was sourced from
    https://placehold.co/300x200
    - A frog meme image sourced from
    https://tinyurl.com/3fw3hupu
